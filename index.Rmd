title: "Zev Rosen Final Portfolio"
---

My name is Zev Rosen and I am a junior at Georgetown University majoring in mathematics and economics. I created this website for my final project in Professor Meyer's Data Visualization and Graphics class. The website contains four guided exercises and a final project analyzing women's tennis grand slam match data.
